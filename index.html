				<h2>Multi-Agent System for Investment Analysis</h2>
				<p align="justify">The Investment Portfolio Analyzer is an advanced multi-agent system that delivers
					data-driven investment recommendations by analyzing real-time news coverage and market sentiment.
					The system evaluates investment opportunities across multiple dimensions—including market sentiment,
					emerging developments, and risk factors—to generate nuanced buy, sell, or hold recommendations with
					confidence metrics, all accessible through a user-friendly web interface.
				<p>
					The solution is implemented using Python 3.12+, LangGraph and LangChain for agent orchestration,
					OpenAI's GPT-4 as
					the LLM, Google Custom Search API for comprehensive news gathering, and Streamlit
					for the web interface.
